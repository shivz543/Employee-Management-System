## **Project Structure**
üîß How It Works
1. Admin Login
The system starts with the index.html page, which is the login screen for administrators.
Style highlights: Modern, clean interface with an inline image for aesthetics.
2. Dashboard
Accessible upon login, the dashboard provides navigation links for:
View Employees
Add Employee
Placeholder links for "View Departments" and "View Tasks".
3. Add Employee
A form collects new employee details, including:
Name
Email
Department (dropdown menu)
Position
Salary
Data is stored in LocalStorage to dynamically update the employee list.
4. View Employees
Displays employee data in a responsive, styled table.
Data is fetched from LocalStorage and dynamically inserted into the table.
üå± Future Enhancements
This project is designed for scalability, with the following features planned for future development:

Database Integration: Replace LocalStorage with a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) for persistent data storage.
Authentication: Implement a secure login system with role-based access control.
Task Assignment: Enable task management functionality for employees.
Enhanced Responsiveness: Fully optimize for mobile and tablet devices.
API Integration: Allow integration with external HR management tools.
